# Music Identification
The purpose of audio identification is to assign a title to a broadcast song. In this project, we are interested in identification by fingerprinting and by matching an audio query to an element of a large database. Fingerprinting identification is based on the extraction of features that concisely, uniquely and robustly describe different music tracks. This representation is based on acoustic properties.
